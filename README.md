# MyBike landing page
The landing page is based on layout created in Figma. The responsive design ensures that the page adapts to different screen sizes, such as desktop, tablet, and mobile, allowing users to access the content effortlessly from any device. For better user experience on mobile devices I implemented a hamburger navigation menu with Anchor Links that enable smoothly scrolling to different sections of the page.
### Used technologies:
